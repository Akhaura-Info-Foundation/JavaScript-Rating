Easy to use and customise Pure JavaScript rating using HTML and CSS. Few clicks to install and configure, no additional plugin or script needed. Good for product rating or e-commerce website.

2. Call rating function with percentage and get output.
<script>rate(25);</script>



Remember :
You can call this function as many times as you want.
You have to mention rating value as percentage (0-100).
You can use this rating in-line (text before or text after).
